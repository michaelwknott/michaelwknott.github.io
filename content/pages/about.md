Hello, I'm Michael.

I'm a Strength and Conditioning Coach and Python Developer.

I'm currently using Python to solve performance problems for the coaches and athletes I support.

This blog will be a place for me to store and collate the things I learn as I continue to utilise Python on a daily basis.
